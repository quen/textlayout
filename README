Text layout formatting library required for leafChat. Supports wrapped text
output, scrolling text, highlighting text for selection, bordered boxes,
etc.

This library uses a weird CSS-like stylesheet system for layout. No plans to
document it better; I don't really recommend anyone else uses it (although it
is quite powerful, so feel free if you want to try).
